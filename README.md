# FeeDon This!
FeeDon This! is a service for Mastodon instances that allows users to generate RSS feeds from their home timeline, local timeline, and any lists they've created. Technically speaking you can _mostly_ do this by just subscribing to individual users' timelines in your RSS reader, but this doesn't work well if you want to keep your RSS reader in-sync with who you follow or follow users with private posts.
